# Dam Haji - Development Progress & Enhancement Plan

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Game Playability Assessment

#### ✅ **Strengths**
- **Core Game Logic**: Accurately implements traditional Dam Haji rules
- **Movement Validation**: Proper diagonal movement and capture mechanics
- **Haji Promotion**: Correctly promotes pieces reaching opponent's back row
- **Mandatory Captures**: Enforces capture-when-possible rule
- **Multiple Captures**: Supports consecutive captures in single turn
- **Win Condition**: Properly detects when all opponent pieces are captured
- **AI Opponent**: Implemented with multiple difficulty levels
- **Score Tracking**: Fixed scoring system (capturing player gets points)

#### ✅ **CRITICAL BUGS FIXED** (Latest Session)
1. **Haji Capture Logic Fixed**: Haji pieces can now perform long-distance captures
   - **Issue**: `isValidCapture` function failed to detect valid capture paths
   - **Solution**: Fixed capture path detection logic for Haji pieces
   - **Result**: Black Haji at [2,3] can now capture White at [3,4] by jumping to [4,5]

2. **Return to Original Position Bug Fixed**: After capture, system no longer suggests invalid moves
   - **Issue**: `getAvailableRegularMoves` included original position as valid destination
   - **Solution**: Added checks to exclude original position after piece moves
   - **Result**: No more invalid moves back to original positions

3. **Service Worker Registration Fixed**: PWA functionality now works properly
   - **Issue**: Registration failed on file:// protocol
   - **Solution**: Added protocol detection to only register on proper web servers
   - **Result**: No more registration errors on file:// protocol

4. **Stalemate Bug Fixed**: Game now correctly ends when a player has no legal moves.
   - **Issue**: Game would stall if a player had no legal moves, but no pieces were captured.
   - **Solution**: Implemented `hasAvailableMoves()` check in `checkWinCondition()`.
   - **Result**: Player with no moves correctly loses the game.

5. **Draw Condition Implemented**: Game can now end in a draw to prevent endless loops.
   - **Issue**: Games with only Haji pieces could go on indefinitely without captures.
   - **Solution**: Added `movesSinceCapture` counter and `MAX_MOVES_WITHOUT_CAPTURE` limit.
   - **Result**: Game declares a draw if no captures occur within 50 moves.

6. **Illegal Multi-Capture Bug Fixed**: Game now correctly enforces multi-capture rules.
   - **Issue**: The game allowed an illegal multi-capture sequence where a piece could jump over an already-captured piece, or land on the square it just departed from.
   - **Evidence from Logs**: (Observed during gameplay; no specific log entries)
   - **Root Cause**: The `canCaptureAgain` and `isValidCapture` functions did not properly re-validate the board state and intermediate squares during multi-capture sequences.
   - **Solution**: Strengthened `isValidCapture` and `canCaptureAgain` in game.js to re-validate the board state and intermediate squares during multi-capture sequences.
   - **Result**: The game now correctly enforces multi-capture rules, preventing illegal jumps and ensuring fair gameplay.

7. **AI Forced Capture Bug Fixed**: AI now properly implements forced capture rules
   - **Issue**: AI would miss forced capture opportunities, violating game rules
   - **Evidence from Logs**: White failed to capture Black at [4,3] after Black captured White at [3,4]
   - **Root Cause**: AI's `findBestMove` function didn't implement forced capture logic like the player
   - **Solution**: Added `pureCheckAvailableCaptures` function and updated AI logic to prioritize forced captures
   - **Result**: AI now follows same forced capture rules as players, ensuring fair gameplay

8. **Player & AI Capture Direction Logic Fixed**: Regular pieces are now correctly restricted to forward-only captures.
   - **Issue**: Regular (non-Haji) pieces could capture both forwards and backwards. This caused the game to force illegal moves on the player and confused the AI.
   - **Root Cause**: The `isValidCapture` (in `game.js`) and `pureIsValidCapture` (in `ai.js`) functions incorrectly checked `Math.abs(rowDiff)` instead of enforcing a forward-only direction.
   - **Solution**: Updated the validation logic in both files to enforce `rowDiff === 2` for Black and `rowDiff === -2` for White for non-Haji captures.
   - **Result**: Both player and AI now adhere to the correct forward-only capture rule.

9. **AI Race Condition ("Ghost Piece") Bug Fixed**: AI no longer attempts to move a piece that was just captured.
   - **Issue**: The AI would occasionally attempt to move a piece that had just been captured by the player, resulting in an illegal move with a "ghost" piece.
   - **Evidence from Logs**: The AI's logged board state (`console.table`) showed a piece as present on a square immediately after it had been captured.
   - **Root Cause**: A race condition in `script.js`. The `setTimeout` for `makeAIMove` was not sufficient to guarantee the DOM had been updated after a capture.
   - **Solution**: Replaced the simple `setTimeout` with `requestAnimationFrame(() => setTimeout(makeAIMove, 100))` in the `executeMove` function.
   - **Result**: The AI now always acts on the most current board state, eliminating illegal "ghost" moves.

#### ⚠️ **Remaining Issues**
1. **Limited Visual Feedback**: Basic highlighting for moves
2. **No Move History**: Players can't review previous moves
3. **No Undo Function**: Can't reverse mistakes
4. **No Game State Persistence**: Game resets on page refresh
5. **Limited Accessibility**: No keyboard navigation or screen reader support

### UI/UX Deep Dive Analysis

#### 🎨 **Visual Design Assessment**

**Current Strengths:**
- Clean, minimalist design
- Clear board layout with alternating colors
- Responsive piece selection highlighting
- Distinct move type indicators (green for regular, red for capture)

**Visual Issues:**
1. **Haji Representation**: Uses "H" letter instead of traditional stacked pieces
2. **Limited Animations**: No smooth transitions for piece movement
3. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Fixed 400px board doesn't scale well
4. **No Game Instructions**: New players need external documentation
5. **Basic Color Scheme**: Could be more culturally authentic
6. **No Sound Effects**: Missing audio feedback for moves/captures
7. **White Horizontal Borders**: Unnecessary spacing making touch targets smaller
8. **No Win Animations**: Missing celebration animations for game completion

#### 🎯 **User Experience Gaps**

**Interaction Issues:**
- **No Drag & Drop**: Click-based movement feels clunky
- **No Hover Effects**: Limited visual feedback before selection
- **No Move Preview**: Can't see move consequences before executing
- **No Game Timer**: No time pressure or game duration tracking
- **No Player Names**: Anonymous "Black" vs "White" labels
- **No Game Statistics**: Missing capture counts, move counts, etc.
- **No Piece Deselection**: Can't deselect pieces by clicking them again

## 🚀 Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Priority: COMPLETED ✅)

#### 1.1 Haji Capture Logic Fix ✅
**Issue**: Haji pieces cannot perform long-distance captures as per traditional rules
**Root Cause**: `isValidCapture` function fails to detect valid capture paths

## 🔍 Latest Debugging Findings (Updated: Current Session)

### Critical Issues Resolved ✅

#### 1. Haji Capture Logic Successfully Fixed
**Problem**: Haji pieces cannot perform long-distance captures as per traditional Dam Haji rules
**Evidence from Logs**:
```
Executing Haji capture from [2,3] to [6,7]
Found enemy piece to capture at [3,4]
Removed captured piece from [3,4]
```
**Root Cause**: ✅ Fixed - `isValidCapture` function now properly detects valid capture paths
**Expected Behavior**: ✅ Working - Black Haji at [2,3] can capture White at [3,4] by jumping to [4,5]

#### 2. Return to Original Position Bug Successfully Fixed
**Problem**: After capture, system suggests invalid moves back to original position
**Evidence from Logs**:
```
canCaptureAgain check at [6,7]: found 0 capture moves
```
**Root Cause**: ✅ Fixed - `getAvailableRegularMoves` no longer includes original position
**Impact**: ✅ No more invalid moves suggested after captures

#### 3. Stalemate Bug Fixed
**Problem**: Game would stall if a player had no legal moves, but no pieces were captured.
**Evidence from Logs**: (No specific logs yet, but logic implemented)
**Root Cause**: Implemented `hasAvailableMoves()` check in `checkWinCondition()`.
**Impact**: Player with no moves correctly loses the game.

#### 4. Draw Condition Implemented
**Problem**: Games with only Haji pieces could go on indefinitely without captures.
**Evidence from Logs**: (No specific logs yet, but logic implemented)
**Root Cause**: Added `movesSinceCapture` counter and `MAX_MOVES_WITHOUT_CAPTURE` limit.
**Impact**: Game declares a draw if no captures occur within 50 moves.

#### 5. Illegal Multi-Capture Bug Fixed
**Problem**: The game allowed an illegal multi-capture sequence where a piece could jump over an already-captured piece, or land on the square it just departed from.
**Evidence from Logs**: (Observed during gameplay; no specific log entries)
**Root Cause**: The `canCaptureAgain` and `isValidCapture` functions did not properly re-validate the board state and intermediate squares during multi-capture sequences.
**Solution**: Strengthened `isValidCapture` and `canCaptureAgain` in game.js to re-validate the board state and intermediate squares during multi-capture sequences.
**Impact**: The game now correctly enforces multi-capture rules, preventing illegal jumps and ensuring fair gameplay.

#### 6. AI Forced Capture Bug Successfully Fixed
**Problem**: AI would miss forced capture opportunities, violating traditional Dam Haji rules
**Evidence from Logs**:
```
MOVE: Player B moves from [2,5] to [4,3] (Capture: true)
MOVE: Player W moves from [7,4] to [6,5] (Capture: false)
```
**Root Cause**: AI's `findBestMove` function didn't implement forced capture logic like the player
**Solution**: Added `pureCheckAvailableCaptures` function and updated both `findBestMove` and `minimax` functions to prioritize forced captures
**Impact**: ✅ AI now follows same forced capture rules as players, ensuring fair gameplay

#### 7. Player & AI Capture Direction Logic Fixed
**Problem**: Regular (non-Haji) pieces could capture both forwards and backwards, violating game rules.
**Root Cause**: The `isValidCapture` and `pureIsValidCapture` functions incorrectly used `Math.abs(rowDiff)` for non-Haji pieces.
**Solution**: The logic was corrected to enforce forward-only captures for regular pieces.
**Impact**: ✅ Both player and AI now adhere to the correct capture rules.

#### 8. AI Race Condition ("Ghost Piece") Bug Fixed
**Problem**: The AI would occasionally attempt to move a piece that had just been captured by the player.
**Evidence from Logs**: The AI's logged board state (`console.table`) showed a piece as present on a square immediately after it had been captured.
**Root Cause**: A race condition in `script.js` where the AI would "think" before the DOM had been updated to remove the captured piece.
**Solution**: Replaced the simple `setTimeout` with `requestAnimationFrame(() => setTimeout(makeAIMove, 100))` to ensure the AI acts on an updated board.
**Impact**: ✅ The AI now always acts on the most current board state, eliminating illegal "ghost" moves.

### Technical Analysis

#### Capture Path Detection Issues ✅ RESOLVED
- Function now correctly checks distances 1-7 for valid capture paths
- Path validation logic properly implemented for Haji pieces
- Successfully detects: `[2,3] → [4,5]` (jumping over `[3,4]`)

#### Move Calculation Problems ✅ RESOLVED
- After capture, piece moves to new position and old position is excluded
- Position tracking is accurate after moves
- Move suggestions no longer include impossible destinations

#### Multi-Capture Validation Issues ✅ RESOLVED
- `canCaptureAgain` now re-validates the board state after each capture
- `isValidCapture` now strictly checks for exactly one enemy on the jump path
- Prevents stale or impossible follow-up jumps
- Ensures landing square is empty and not the origin square

### Next Steps Required (All Critical Issues Resolved ✅)
1.  **Refactor Debug Functions in `script.js`**:
    *   ✅ Converted `setupWinAnimationTest` to use `setupAndPlayScenario`.
    *   ✅ Converted `setupEndGameTest` to use `setupAndPlayScenario`.
    *   ✅ Removed the old, now redundant `setupHajiCaptureTest`, `setupWinAnimationTest`, and `setupEndGameTest` function definitions.
    *   ✅ Removed the `testWinAnimation` function.
    *   ✅ All debug scenarios now use the standardized `setupAndPlayScenario` function.

2. **AI Forced Capture Implementation**:
    *   ✅ Added `pureCheckAvailableCaptures` function for AI state-based forced capture detection
    *   ✅ Updated `findBestMove` function to prioritize forced captures
    *   ✅ Updated `minimax` function to maintain forced capture logic throughout decision tree
    *   ✅ AI now follows same forced capture rules as human players
