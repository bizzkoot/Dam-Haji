# Mobile Sizing Implementation Notes

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **CSS Updates**:
   - Modified `#board-container` to include width/height properties and better flex handling
   - Updated `#game-board` to remove viewport-based sizing and added `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` for perfect square maintenance
   - Kept existing media queries for mobile responsiveness

2. **JavaScript Enhancements**:
   - Added `updateBoardSize()` method to dynamically calculate board dimensions based on container size
   - Added `initBoardResizing()` method to set up ResizeObserver for automatic resizing
   - Integrated board resizing into the UI initialization process
   - Enhanced `handleResize()` method to update board size on window resize events

3. **Mobile Space Management**:
   - Kept existing CSS-based approach for showing/hiding mobile game info based on screen height
   - Added `checkMobileSpacePermitting()` method for future enhancements (currently unused but ready for expansion)

## Key Features Implemented

- **Dynamic Board Sizing**: The board now dynamically adjusts to fit the available space within its container, rather than using fixed viewport units
- **Perfect Square Aspect Ratio**: Using CSS `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` to maintain a perfect square board
- **Responsive Design**: Board properly responds to window/container size changes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Header bar, AI controls, board, and action buttons always visible on screen
- **Conditional Content Display**: Movement history only shows when sufficient space is available

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- JavaScript syntax errors (using modern ES6+ features)
- CSS compatibility with existing styles
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Integration with existing UI components

## Future Enhancements

- Further refine the `checkMobileSpacePermitting()` method to dynamically determine available space for mobile game info
- Add more sophisticated space calculations based on actual element measurements
- Implement container queries as browser support improves
