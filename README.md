- White pieces move upward (decreasing row numbers)
- One square at a time

#### Haji (King) Pieces
- Promoted when a piece reaches the opponent's back row
- Can move diagonally in any direction (forward and backward)
- Can move multiple squares in one turn

### Capture Rules

#### Mandatory Captures

- **Multiple Captures**: A piece can continue capturing in the same turn
- **No Return**: Cannot return to the original position during multi-capture

#### Capture Mechanics
- **Regular Pieces**: Jump over opponent piece to land on empty square
- **Haji Pieces**: Can capture over long distances, jumping multiple squares
- **Path Validation**: Must land on empty square, cannot jump over own pieces

## 🎮 How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Open the Game**: Launch in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Choose Mode**: 
   - **Player vs Player**: Two human players
   - **Player vs AI**: Play against computer opponent
3. **Select Difficulty**: If playing vs AI, choose Easy, Medium, or Hard
4. **Start Playing**: Black moves first

### Game Controls
- **Select Piece**: Click on your piece to highlight available moves
- **Make Move**: Click on highlighted square to move
- **Deselect**: Click selected piece again to deselect
- **Reset Game**: Use the reset button to start a new game

### Auto-Save & Restore
- **Per-Move Saving**: Every completed move (yours or the AI's) is saved to local storage immediately
- **Restore Prompt**: When you close and reopen the app, it offers to restore the exact position from just before the close
- **Decline to Start Fresh**: Declining the prompt (or finishing a game, or resetting) clears the saved snapshot
- **Save Slots**: Manual save/load slots mirror the same in-progress snapshot behavior
- **Force Refresh**: Settings → App → **Force Refresh App** clears all cached files (and the service worker), saves the current game, and reloads — use this if the app ever looks out of date or misbehaves

### Win Conditions
- **Capture All Opponent Pieces**: Eliminate all enemy pieces
- **Block Opponent**: Leave opponent with no legal moves
- **Draw**: No captures for 50 consecutive moves

## 🧪 Development

Run the persistence smoke test (no dependencies) after touching save/restore code:

```bash
node tests/autosave-smoke.js
```

It loads the real `game.js` + `script.js` in a minimal DOM stub and verifies the save → close → restore contract end to end.

## 🚀 PWA Features

### Live Deployment
